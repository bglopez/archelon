I live more than half my waking life in a shell, and one of my
frustrations has always been having a nicely searchable and synced
shell history across hundreds of servers.  This is my attempt at
solving this problem using a curses client for searching paired with a
simple API and Web server backed by a nice search engine
(Elasticsearch).

The project is split in two, and the client is actually pretty cool
without the Web server.  To get started, check out the
`documentation <http://archelon.rtfd.org/>`_.
