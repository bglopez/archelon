I live more than half my waking life in a shell, and one of my
frustrations has always been having a nicely searchable and synced
shell history across hundreds of servers.  This is my attempt at
solving this problem using a curses client for searching paired with a
simple API and Web server backed by a nice search engine
(Elasticsearch).

The project is split in two, and the client is actually pretty cool
without the Web server.  To get started, check out each of the
projects below.
